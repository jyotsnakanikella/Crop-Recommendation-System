This crop recommendation system is written in R programming language and using Data mining for processing the data and do accurate predictions, weka to generate datasets which takes datasets of various crops like crop name, temperature range where it grows, soil properties, nearest distance where the crop is being harvested by other farmers, raw materials, place where the raw materials are available.
Then it can predict whether to grow a particular crop and what is the reason if it predicts no(might be many farmers near by are growing the same crop/ raw materials needed for the crop are distant/the given temperature and soil types might not be suiting the crop properties).
The system also shows visual representation of each scenario which better shows the various properties.
